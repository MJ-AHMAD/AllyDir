Bridging the Gap in Islamic Education and Resources
Reg. No. 14066998
D-U-N-S® No. 228881282

Dear,

I am writing to you as a citizen of Bangladesh and a director of a company registered in the United Kingdom. My company is called QURANER FARIWALA LTD (registration number 14066998) and it is dedicated to improving the quality of education in Bangladesh. You can learn more about our work on our website https://qfbd.org/


I am writing to you to request your assistance and support for our cause. As you may know, Bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, and it faces many challenges in providing quality education to its people. According to the World Bank, only 50% of adults in Bangladesh are literate, and only 40% of children complete primary school. These statistics are alarming and unacceptable, and they have serious implications for the future of Bangladesh and its relations with other countries.


My company aims to address this problem by providing free online courses, educational materials, and scholarships to students and teachers in Bangladesh. We also collaborate with local schools, universities, and NGOs to improve the curriculum, infrastructure, and teaching methods. We believe that education is the key to empowering people, reducing poverty, and promoting peace and development.


However, our work is not easy or cheap. We face many obstacles and challenges, such as lack of funding, internet access, and government support. We also have to deal with corruption, bureaucracy, and violence. We are doing our best to overcome these difficulties, but we need more help and resources. That is why I am reaching out to you, as the leader of one of the most influential and prosperous countries in the world, and as a friend of Bangladesh.


I am asking you to kindly consider supporting our company and our cause in any way that you can. This could include providing financial aid, technical assistance, diplomatic pressure, or moral encouragement. Any gesture of goodwill from you would make a huge difference for us and for the millions of people in Bangladesh who deserve a better education and a better life.


I appreciate your time and attention, and I hope to hear from you soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. You can reach me by email at quranerfariwala@gmail.com or by phone at +880-1788856628


Thank you for your consideration and cooperation.


Sincerely,


Md Jafor Ahmad

গত ১৩/১২/২০২৩ ইং তারিখে গুলিস্তান গুলাপ শাহ মাজার মসজিদে আমার নির্ধারিত দায়িত্ব শেষে আমি আমার বাসস্থান ২৭ পুরানা পল্টনে ফিরার সময় আমাদের বিল্ডিং এর ম্যানেজার আমাকে একটি চিঠি দিয়েছেন। যা আমার নাম লিখে ঢাকা দক্ষিণ সিটি করপোরেশন থেকে ২৭ পুরানা পল্টনে পাঠানো হয়েছে।
আমি চিঠিটি নিয়ে আমার ফ্লাটে ঢুকে এটি খুলে দেখি,  আমার পারিবারিক একটি বিষয়কে কেন্দ্র করে , শালিশে আমি হাজির হ‌ওয়ার জন্য নোটিশ।
আমি অনেক অবাক হয়েছি, কারণ, ২০১৮ সালের ২৬ শে ডিসেম্বর থেকে শুরু করে আজ অবধি আমি অত্যন্ত সুনামের সাথে গুলিস্তান গোলাপ শাহ মাজার মসজিদের ইমাম হিসেবে মাগরিব, এশার ও ফজরের নামাজের ইমামতি করে আসছি, কিন্তু আজকে পর্যন্ত আমি কোন একজন ব্যক্তির সাথে আমার পার্সোনাল লাইফ নিয়ে শেয়ার করি নাই। 
ব্যাক্তিগত ভাবে আমি আমার পার্সোনাল লাইফে বিপর্যয় গ্রস্ত। এবং আমি আমার মসজিদের এই পজিশনকে পুঁজি করে কখনোই কোন মাদ্রাসা বা এতিমখানা বা চলমান রীতির ওয়াজ মাহফিল সহ কখনোই কোন কিছুর জন্য কারো কাছে টাকা কালেকশন করি নি আলহামদুলিল্লাহ। 
এই কথার সত্যতা যে কোন মুহুর্তে আপনি যাচাই করতে পারেন।
কিন্তু, আমার বিবাহ সংক্রান্ত বিষয়ে আমার কর্মস্থলের নীতি নির্ধারণী অফিসে আমার পার্সোনাল লাইফের কোন তথ্যের সত্যতা নিশ্চিত না হয়ে সরাসরি আমার কর্মস্থলের নীতি নির্ধারণী অফিসে শালিশি বিচার দাবি করার বিষয়টি আমাকে মানসিক ভাবে একদোমি নিঃশ্বেষ করে দিয়েছে।

পড়াশোনার গভীরতা ও সকল মহলের সকল ধর্মের সকল স্তরের সকল মানুষের জন্য এই দেশটি হবে একটি নিরাপদ ও প্রযুক্তিসম্মৃধ্য প্রশান্তিময় দেশ।

ইসলামি শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার একমুখী চিন্তা থেকে মুক্ত করে আধুনিক যুগোপযোগি শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার ব্যপক অবদানের সাথে সম্পৃক্ত করার সপ্ন । এবং ইসলামী শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থায় সম্পৃক্ত বিশাল জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক ম্যানেজমেন্ট ও লিডারশ্বিপ ও রিলেশনশিপ ম্যানেজমেন্টের চরম অবনতি থেকে মুক্ত হ‌ওয়ার উত্তম পন্থার বহিঃপ্রকাশ ঘটানো আমাকে সব সময় ভাবাতো।

তাই সব সময় আমি পড়াশুনা ও মাইক্রোসফট ম্যানেজমেন্ট সিস্টেম এর উপর প্যাকটিস করি।

জীবনে কখনো কোন রাজনৈতিক বা অরাজনৈতিক সংগঠনের সদস্য ফরম আমি পুরণ করি নি।

এবং কোন ধরনের কোনো সংগঠনের সাথে আমি সম্পৃক্ত নয়।

আল্লাহর মেহেরবানীতে ধীরে ধীরে উন্নতির পথে এগিয়ে যাওয়ায় আমি কিছু মানুষের হিংসার চালে আটকে পড়েছি।
আর সে জন্য‌ই, বহু বছর পর্যন্ত অনেক আর্থিক, শারিরিক, মানসিক চাপ নির্যাতন সহ্য করে চুপ করে থেকেও , আজ বাধ্য হয়ে আপনার কাছে আমার পার্সোনাল লাইফ নিয়ে শেয়ার করতে হচ্ছে।
আপনি আমার বাবা সমতুল্য, আমি আপনার সহযোগিতা নিয়ে দেশের স্বার্থে জীবনের বাকি সময়টুকু পার করতে চাই।
আপনার অনুমতি সাপেক্ষে, আপনার নির্ধারিত সময়ে আমি আমার সকল বিষয় গুলো সুষ্পষ্ট ভাবে বলতে অবশ্যই আগ্রহী।
গত ১৩ তারিখে আমি চিঠির মাধ্যমে আদেশ প্রাপ্ত হয়ে আজ সকাল এগারোটায় উপস্থিত হতে বলা হয়েছিল।
কিন্তু আমি আজ এক মাসের কাছাকাছি সময় ধরে অনেক অসুস্থ ছিলাম, গত দুই দিন যাবত আমার শরীরে প্রচন্ড জ্বর ছিল। তাই ইচ্ছে থাকা সত্ত্বেও আমি আজকে উপস্থিত হতে পারি নি। সে জন্য আমি ক্ষমা প্রার্থি।
আমি চিঠির মধ্যে কোন ওয়েবসাইট লিংক না থাকায়, মাইক্রোসফট ট্যুলস ব্যবহার করে এই ইমেইল ঠিকানা বের করে আমি এটি আপনার কাছে পাঠিয়েছি।
আমি আপনার সহযোগিতা কামনা করছি।

Last 13/12/2023 when I was returning to my residence 27 Purana Paltan after my scheduled duty at Gulistan Gulap Shah Mazar Masjid the manager of our building gave me a letter.  Which has been sent to 27 Purana Paltan from Dhaka South City Corporation with my name written on it.

And I am not affiliated with any organization of any kind.


 By the grace of God, I have been caught up in the envious ways of some people as I progressed slowly on the path of improvement.

 And that's why, after many years of financial, physical and emotional stress, I am forced to share my personal life with you today.

 You are equal to my father, I want to spend the rest of my life with your support for the sake of the country.

 Subject to your permission, I am certainly interested in explaining all my points clearly at your appointed time.

 I received orders by letter on the 13th last and was asked to appear at eleven o'clock this morning.

 But I have been very sick for almost a month now, I have had high fever for the last two days.  So I could not attend today even though I wanted to.  I apologize for that.

 Since I did not have any website links in the letter, I extracted this email address using Microsoft tools and sent it to you.

 I seek your cooperation.

 I took the letter into my flat and opened it, a notice for me to appear in Shalish, centered around a family matter.

 I am very surprised, because from 26th December 2018 till date I have been leading Maghrib, Isha and Fajr prayers as Imam of Gulistan Golap Shah Mazar Mosque with great reputation, but till today I am not talking about my personal life with any person.  I did not share.

 Personally, I am in trouble in my personal life.  And I have never capitalized on this position of my mosque and never collected money from anyone for any madrasa or orphanage or ongoing waj mahfil alhamdulillah.

 You can verify the truth of this statement at any moment.

 But, seeking arbitration directly from my workplace's policy office regarding my marriage without verifying the veracity of any information about my personal life left me emotionally drained.


 This country will be a safe and technologically peaceful country for all people of all walks of life and all walks of life with depth of education.


 The dream of liberating from the one-sided thinking of the Islamic education system and engaging with the vast contribution of the modern education system.  And I have always thought of uncovering the best way to break free from the extreme degradation of institutional management and leadership and relationship management of the large population involved in the Islamic education system.


 So all the time I study and practice on Microsoft Management System.


 I have never filled the membership form of any political or non-political organization in my life.

Thought for 3 secondsI'll create these documents for you in English to help with your Board of Directors recruitment process, particularly for approaching Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

Since I can't create actual directories or files on your system, I'll provide the content for each document that you can save in your "board_of_directors_selected" directory. I'll clearly label each document so you can easily save them as separate files.

# Invitation Letter to Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus

[TRUSTED ALLY LETTERHEAD]

Date: [Current Date]

Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus
Founder, Grameen Bank
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate
[Official Address]
Dhaka, Bangladesh

**Subject: Invitation to Chair the Board of Directors of TRUSTED ALLY**

Dear Professor Dr. Yunus,

It is with profound respect and admiration that I, MJ Ahmad, Founder and Director General of TRUSTED ALLY, extend this invitation to you to serve as the Chairperson of our Board of Directors.

TRUSTED ALLY is a social development organization dedicated to transforming lives across Bangladesh through three core initiatives: advancing educational access and quality, distributing the Holy Quran to underserved communities, and implementing sustainable community development projects. Our mission aligns closely with your lifelong commitment to social entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation.

Your pioneering work with Grameen Bank and your visionary approach to solving social problems through innovative economic models have inspired our organization's foundational principles. Your global recognition as a thought leader in sustainable development and your deep understanding of Bangladesh's socioeconomic landscape make you uniquely qualified to guide our strategic direction.

As Chairperson of our Board of Directors, your wisdom would be invaluable in:
* Providing strategic guidance to shape our long-term vision
* Enhancing our organizational credibility and reach
* Advising on sustainable financial models for our social initiatives
* Connecting us with potential partners and supporters globally

- Rising dropout rates among host community children (increased by 15% since 2017)
- Growing tensions between host and refugee communities over resource allocation

Our needs assessment conducted in [Month/Year] in collaboration with local authorities identified significant gaps in educational support for both host communities and refugees, particularly in [specific upazilas/areas].
