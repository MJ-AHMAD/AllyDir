Subject: Application for Field Support Collaboration and Economic Assistance

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am MJ AHMAD, a resident living in close proximity to your Cox's Bazar office. I am writing to express my interest in collaborating with IOM on field operations while seeking economic support through meaningful work opportunities.

## Background and Experience

I have extensive experience and knowledge of Cox's Bazar, Teknaf, and the Rohingya camps, having worked closely with local communities and humanitarian initiatives in these areas. My familiarity with the geographical terrain, local customs, and the unique challenges faced by both host communities and displaced populations positions me as a valuable resource for your field operations.

## Proposed Collaboration

I am offering my services to support IOM's field activities in the following capacities:

1. **Field Coordination Support**: Assisting your team with ground-level coordination, community engagement, and logistical support.

2. **Local Liaison**: Facilitating communication between IOM staff and local communities, leveraging my understanding of local dialects and cultural nuances.

3. **Data Collection & Monitoring**: Supporting needs assessments, beneficiary feedback collection, and program monitoring activities.

4. **Community Mobilization**: Helping organize community meetings, awareness sessions, and other field-level activities.

## Project Portfolio and Initiatives

I am currently developing several initiatives aimed at sustainable development and community support in Cox's Bazar district, including:

- Digital infrastructure development for improved service delivery
- Educational support programs for vulnerable communities
- Economic empowerment initiatives for local residents

These projects align with IOM's mission of supporting vulnerable populations and could potentially complement your existing programs. More information about these initiatives can be found at:
- [Project website link]
- [Social media presence]
- [Previous work documentation]

## Request for Support

While I am passionate about contributing to humanitarian efforts in our region, I am currently facing financial constraints that limit my ability to fully realize these initiatives. A collaboration with IOM would not only provide me with much-needed economic support but would also allow me to contribute meaningfully to your mission.

## Mutual Benefits

This collaboration would benefit IOM by:
- Providing access to local expertise and community networks
- Enhancing field operations through local knowledge
- Improving community engagement and acceptance
- Supporting your existing programs with complementary initiatives

I am available at your convenience for an interview or meeting to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. I am flexible regarding work arrangements and ready to start immediately.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with IOM to support vulnerable communities in Cox's Bazar.

Sincerely,

MJ AHMAD
